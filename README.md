# Praat Script TS TextStyles

Praat Plugin for setting text styles for multiple TextGrids.

v1.0.2 2021/02/10

Thomas Sch√∂kler

## Notes

The original purpose of this script was to set text styles globally (e.g the default settings turn every first tier of every grid italic) but it can be used for any global insertion or removal of strings.

All TextGrids in the current selection will be affected. Other selected objects will be ignored.

Empty point tiers will be skipped. The treatment of empty intervals/points can be selected by the user.

v1.0.1: Intervals/points already set to the selected text style ("%%", "##", "^^", or "__") are skipped.

v1.0.2: Negative tier numbers will be counted starting from the bottom.
